There are 177 unique staff members including Snake, your avatar, Miller, Ocelot etc. However some of them don't have attached pics (see \master\data1\Assets\tpp\motherbase\script\MbmCommonSetting.lua). Best example is Silent Basilisk (staff_name_99_056) without faceId property. All soldiers with faceId property ripped from scripts have 'fid_from_scripts' flag in staff.json, others were found manually.

Some of them have missionId property, which shows where you can extract them. This property also means that these soldiers have to be rescued as prisoners. Soldiers like Malak don't have missionId because you must extract them to finish the mission.

There is no info about prisoners in side missions (or at least I haven't found it yet).
Every soldier has his unique ID, which you can use for modding; for example replace Silent Basilisk with Ivory Skull to get her almost legally.

Some faces are unique and some may change; for example your Flaming Buffalo can have a slightly different face, while Hideo has only one portrait.

Notes are based on ingame scripts and can be inaccurate.

You can get pics by extracting them using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rtpumx2mxsjaby/MGSV_QAR_Tool.rar?dl=0">MGSV QAR Tool v1.3 by Sergeanur</a> (and convert with <a href="https://github.com/Atvaark/FtexTool">FtexTool</a>) (there was a MEGA link, but github doesn't like it). Or just clone this repository.

Any help finding remaining portraits and info about sidemissions would be appreciated.
